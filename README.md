## Description

The current project is to create a series of web pages that have the recipes for dishes of my choosing. There should be an index page that acts as my home page and there should be links to other pages for each of the recipes. 

## Skills Used

I used various skills in this project such as using ordered lists for the steps involved in making the recipes and unordered ones for the ingredients. I also used paragraphs, bold text and headers in order to format the text in the way that I want. I also added images and links to make my web pages more user friendly.
