    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>long grain rice (250 g)</strong></li>
        <li><strong>vegetable oil (3 tbsp)</strong></li>
        <li><strong>onion (1 finely chopped)</strong></li>
        <li><strong>eggs (4 beaten)</strong></li>
        <li><strong>spring onions (2 sliced)</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Follow these steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Cook the rice following pack instructions, then drain, <br>
            spread it out to steam-dry and set aside.
        </li><br>

        <li>Heat 2 tbsp of the oil in a large wok over a high heat, <br>
            then add the onion and fry until lightly browned, around 5 mins. <br>
            Add the rice, stir and toast for about 3 mins, then move to the side of the pan.
        </li><br>

        <li>Add the remaining oil, then tip in the egg mixture. <br>
            Leave to cook a little, then mix in with the rice <br>
            - stir vigorously to coat the grains or, if you prefer the egg chunkier, <br>
            allow to set for a little longer before breaking up and stirring through. <br>
            Tip into a serving bowl and scatter over the spring onion to serve. <br>
            You can also add sesame oil, ground white pepper and a splash of soy sauce to season.
        </li><br>
        
    </ol>
