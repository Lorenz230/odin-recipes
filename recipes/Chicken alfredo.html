    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>olive oil (1 tbsp)</strong></li>
        <li><strong>boneless chicken thighs (4 pieces)</strong></li>
        <li><strong>fettuccine (300g)</strong></li>
        <li><strong>butter (1 tbsp)</strong></li>
        <li><strong>nutmeg (half a piece)</strong></li>
        <li><strong>parmesan (100g)</strong></li>
        <li><strong>parsley (chopped)</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Follow these steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>
            Heat the olive oil in a non-stick frying pan over a medium high heat. <br>
            Add the chicken thighs and fry for around 10 mins, turning half way, <br>
            until they are golden brown and cooked through. Set aside to cool a little, <br>
            then use two forks to shred.
        </li><br>

        <li>
            Bring a pan of salted water to the boil and add the pasta, <br>
            cook for 1 minute less that package instructions. Whilst the pasta is cooking,<br>
            add the butter to the frying pan over a medium heat, scraping the bottom a <br>
            little to get any of the browned bits. Tip in the cream along with the nutmeg <br>
            and bring to a simmer. Add the chicken back to the pan.
        </li><br>

        <li>
            Once the pasta is cooked, use tongs to transfer the pasta straight from the water <br>
            into the frying pan with the cream mixture. Sprinkle most of the parmesan over <br>
            and use the tongs to toss it all together, adding a splash of the pasta water <br>
            if it looks a little stiff. Season well, then tip into bowls. <br>
            Top with the remaining parmesan, a scattering of parsley, and black pepper.
        </li><br>
        
    </ol>
