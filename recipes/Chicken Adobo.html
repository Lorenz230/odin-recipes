    <h1>Chicken Adobo</h1>

    <img src="../images/adobo.jpg" alt = "Adobo image">

    <p>Filipino Chicken Adobo is the national dish of the Philippines and may well become your new favourite Asian chicken dish! <br>
        Just a few everyday ingredients I can practically <strong>guarantee</strong> you already have, it’s an effortless recipe that yields juicy, tender chicken <br>
        coated in a sweet savoury glaze with little pops of heat from peppercorns. <br>

        <br>This is a chicken thigh recipe and it <strong>MUST</strong>  be made with thighs – no substituting with chicken breast!
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>boneless skinless chicken thighs (750g)</strong>- cannot substitute with breast, need the fat to transform sauce into a glaze;</li>
        <li><strong>soy sauce (85ml)</strong> - all purpose or light soy sauce.</li>
        <li><strong>white vinegar (1/3 cup + 2 tbsp)</strong> - just everyday, plain white vinegar.</li>
        <li><strong>onions (1 small brown)</strong></li>
        <li><strong>garlic (3 cloves)</strong></li>
        <li><strong>peppercorns (1 tbsp)</strong></li>
        <li><strong>sugar (2 tbsp)</strong></li>
        <li><strong>bay leaves (4 leaves)</strong></li>
        <li><strong>green onion (2)</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Follow these steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Combine the soy sauce, white vinegar and bay leaves with the chicken.<br>
            Mince the garlic and add and mix it in as well and leave it to marinate<br>
            for at least 20 minutes and up to overnight.
        </li>
        <br>

        <li>
            Heat 1 tbsp oil in a skillet over high heat. Remove chicken from marinade <br>
            (reserve marinade) and place in the pan. Sear both sides until browned <br>
            - about 1 minute on each side. Do not cook the chicken all the way through.
        </li>
        <br>

        <li>Remove chicken skillet and set aside.</li>
        <br>

        <li>Heat the remaining oil in skillet. Add garlic and onion, cook 1 1/2 minutes.</li>
        <br>

        <li>
            Add the reserved marinade, water, sugar and black pepper. Bring it to a simmer <br>
            then turn heat down to medium high. Simmer 5 minutes.

        </li>
        <br>

        <li>
            Add chicken smooth side down. Simmer uncovered for 20 to 25 minutes <br> 
            (no need to stir), turning chicken at around 15 minutes, <br>
            until the sauce reduces down to a thick jam-like syrup.
        </li>
        <br>

        <li>
            If the sauce isn't thick enough, remove chicken onto a plate and let the sauce <br>
            simmer by itself - it will thicken much quicker - then return chicken to the skillet <br>
            to coat in the glaze.
        </li>
        <br>

        <li>
            Coat chicken in glaze then serve over rice. Pictured in post as a healthy dinner plate <br>
